# Ansible-middleware workshop

Learn how to deploy JBoss EAP, a postgres database and a load balancer using Ansible and the ansible-middleware library.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

You will need an Red Hat network account to be able to download the JBoss EAP installation zip files.  The account you use must not be managed by SSO in order for the Ansible scripts to be able to authenticate.  You can create a new account by following the instructions in the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/login-actions/registration?client_id=customer-portal&tab_id=RiPOv96eZ74).  You will need to use these credentials when you run the ansible playbooks later in the workshop.
